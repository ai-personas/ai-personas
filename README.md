## Limitations

The current experiment showcases AiPersonas with the potential of GPT-3.5/GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:

- Not a polished application or product, just an experiment
- May not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios
- Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI
